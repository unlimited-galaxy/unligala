1, 2, 3, 4…

I need to stretch properly so I don’t strain my legs.

This reminds me of my school days. The Track &amp; Field Club would often let me run with them during their club activities.

We mostly ran around the school premises, but there were times we ran up a mountain, too. It was always pretty tough, having to run along dangerous paths more suitable for wild animals…

But the scenery at the top of the mountain was always stunning. It’d make all of my exhaustion fly away.

But most of all, it always made me feel like I accomplished something amazing! It’s like I grew a bit stronger every time.

A hero’s all about overcoming trials, after all…☆

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
—Wonderful work, Chiaki-san.

They’ve finished inspecting the area, so we only need to inform them that we’re ready.

It’s almost time… Are you mentally prepared?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yep, no problems here! I can start any time!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I expected nothing less from you. I pray for your success. May God protect you. Amen…♪

All right, let’s begin.

“Chiaki-san. Do you vow to save your partner, and pour your heart and soul, in sickness and in health?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
“Yes! I vow to do so!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
“Your vow has been heard.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“Excellent. Then on your mark—”

“Get set… Go!”
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>The screen shakes with the sound of an explosion</p>

{% bubble Makoto %}
“Hello! I’m Yuuki Makoto, chosen to be your impromptu live host simply because I’m a member of the broadcasting committee at my school!”

“And so the final game begins! Its name — ‘Obstacle Course Contest: Vowing Your Life’”!

“That being said, there is only one competitor! If one had to give him an opponent, it would be himself!”

“Morisawa-senpai— No, let’s call him the player! Please witness the player’s battle!”

“First up: ‘Life Full of Twists and Turns ☆ The 100-Meter Race’! After that, he has to pass through three barriers, and slice the cake at the final point! With that, he’ll have completed his goal!”

“But if he doesn’t make it within the time limit—”

“His partner, Sazanami-kun, will explode!”

…Oh, Senpai started running. Looks like it’s finally begun~

You’ve got this, Morisawa-senpai~ …Wait, he can’t even hear me from here.

Anyway, why’d he make it sound like *I’ll* explode? It’s not me who’s exploding, it’s the wedding cake beside me…

…Well, at least we were <em>supposed</em> to have a model of one here… Also, what’s with the ticking sound behind me?

Uu~ I’m tied to the pillar, so I can’t check what it is…

Why’s the bridal project turning out to be like *this~…*?

    <p>Sounds of explosions</p>

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Fuhahaha! The gunpowder is exploding behind me as I run, just as planned!

There’s a reason this film studio is so famous! Their timing is flawless, after all! It feels thrilling knowing I could be caught in one of the explosions if I’m even a second too slow!

Wait for me, Sazanami! I’ll make sure to slice that cake!

I’ll be the one to protect Sazanami and the world’s peace…! ☆
