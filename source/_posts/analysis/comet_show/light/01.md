A light dive into Comet Show 2 years after its release.

<!-- more -->

{% bubble Kanata yare %}
well, i don't usually have this motivation, and i don't know how to properly treat the children.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
but supernova is an important project to you, right? Chiaki?

so it's not like i don't have the will to help you.
{% endbubble %}

Man I love Supernova Kanata but also wow I can see why Kanata saw Midori and nodded hm
Yes he can do what I couldn’t.
Cuz this attitude of his in Supernova is very similar to Midori lmao
No real “motivation” towards heroes or anything but “for Chiaki I would do it”… 😌
This too… Chiaki being ???? With Kanata’s wording and not being sure what he means.
It really explains why Chiaki always was scared that he was just dragging everyone along his
Dreams by force…
Hes so funny yet so cute… he really just doesn’t care that much about the bad guys and it
Doesn’t help that he grew scared of them as well
But I love how here Midoris just 😐 (respect gone down another negative 100) but Tetora
Actually gets Chiakis perspective
Midori: how is it possible to have this much energy
Shinobu: I think cause he didn't sleep well
Midori, a lightbulb clicking in his head: oh now I see (this guys just a regular person like
Anyone else)
The more logic Midori finds to Chiaki’s actions the more he’s like hm. you're really nothing special
Huh (and that makes him fall in love w Chiaki more)
Chiaki’s vision of villains being something thats just an act / pretend vs Kanata who can’t
“pretend” to be a monster when he actually is one … thinks
Tho I feel like I finally get the nuance of this line perfectly Chiaki made him understand
That such a miracle can exist
I wonder if its a foreshadowing to his future arc as well tho…
Makes me wish Supernova could be rewritten with meteor impact’s existence but I’ll take this
Prologue
It really goes to show how Chiaki tried to guide and lead them through everything even
Things he didn’t really know anything about
Actually something else I just noticed.. When Midoris going all oh 🤔 thats why his eyes look red,
Tetora makes a comment to himself (which I think was serious like “oh damn he's literally
Ryusei red /gen”) and Shinobu laughs but Midori doesn't comment on it
But when Kanatas all rawr he joins along and says cute
Shinobu finding the situation very light-hearted and silly whereas Midori and Tetora both are
Like 🤔🤔🤔🤔 in different ways @ Chiaki
And then of course w Kanata… its Kanata so they have no further comments past “omg cute”
The fact Tetora’s comment is like “oh huh his eyes are red… like ryusei red” feels relevant lol
Especially since he makes the same comment in supervillain but it was much more light-hearted
And a genuine joke than it was here
Like Midoris just like oh ! Right right yeah you do get weirdly hyper when you dont sleep
Nodnod now I understand why he's being a weirdo
But Tetoras like ooo red … cuz he's ryusei red… (narration: he doesn't know he ends up being
Pulled into the curse of the red color)
But in supervillain, the comment feels less ""Foreshadowing"" of something, and more "Tetora
Just being a little shit to Midori" which is cute
Kanata…
Just because the hero exists, doesn't mean he should take advantage of his kindness…
This is the funniest exchange ever
Kanata: I'm a pro heh
Chiaki: I can recite every moment yo've almost drowned in water
Chiaki you're killing me I swear to god /neg ugh.
One reason I delayed reading Comet Show was because it means going thru Chiaki exhibiting 500
Red flags when talking to Kanata . But I must trudge through…
Ugh I can't I'm just so (shakes him) no. I must calm down. Things get better for him. Midori
Helps him. Ryuseitai saves him. It'll be ok (I can't handle another sign of how shit life has been for
Chiaki) 👍
He really fucking said “I'm so busy I have to lie to get out of it” what the
Fuck!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ok its out of my system 😌✌️
(breaks a window) I hate these chapters so much
Its like I'm watching Chiaki talk about his abusive rl with… life I guess I don't know but it hurts to read
❤️❤️❤️ ughhh
But at the same time I feel nostalgic of my reaction in 2021 like “ah yeah I was right to be so
Upset when reading these chapters back then lmfao”
Its always Madara even in !! Era 🤔 I didn't think much about it at the time but now that we
Have more context… it goes to show he’s been stuck in the past for so long. He’d always think
This way in ! Times too (in halloween he felt incompetent and wanted Madara’s validation)
Kanata what’s wrong do you wanna talk about you're feelings for Madara ❤️
Love the way Chiaki continues to be the third wheel for these two <3
Its interesting how … blinded? But also reasonable? Chiaki’s view of Madara is. Like before
Meteor impact came out, we mainly had Chiaki and Kanatas views on what happened in the
Past, and Kanata expressed it in a “rogue fucked up and ruined rst” way and Chiaki said it in
A “no it was just bad circumstances” way, and would always see the good in Madara
In the end when the story came out we come to discover Madara was manipulated and
Sabotaged and it led him to take even more hurtful decisions w Kanata
So Chiaki is right in a way to see Madara in good light.
At the same time, he always sees himself as inferior to Madara… since iirc Madara was the
Vice president and w.O Madara, the ex Ryuseitai members would never listen, so ig he always felt
Lower than him
So in a way Chiaki’s reasonable w how he treats Madara but very very blinded by his low self-esteem that he doesn't uh…? Ig realize, maybe? That Madara is… way too fucked up in the
Head to help him lmao 😭 like how tf could Madara help you in your toku show dilemma here!?!
Trying to understand the logic but idgi… maybe I'm missing something from Chiaki’s perspective…
Anyway please bring back honorifics I can't handle Chiaki calling Madara without -san /j
I swear to god at this point Chiaki is just determined to have as many unhealthy rls with ppl
As possible /almost j almost srs
Thank god he’s snapped out of it eventually
The events in !! really strained him so much… he’s so desperate
Not to lose everything I cant
Uuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh awkward
Chiaki I don't know how to say this but I dont think they took what you said well ❤️
Like where do I even begin w this anyway… Chiaki truly does not understand his importance
And relevance in the unit at all. Even tho Kanata would always try to tell him…
Shakes him soo much ughhh
He really fucking said “oh dw Kanata you're the only person I will never strain
Myself with hahaha isnt that so sweet ❤️ we’re so close and bonded that I can do that
With you while I strain my soul being a hero to everyone else” enough. Do not pass go
I truly do not like these chapters so much they tortured me on the first read and tbh I had
Been avoiding them since  I can’t stand to read Chiakis unhealthy relationship with
Heroism I really cant
But also its fascinating how the chapters where Chiaki feels safe because he’s talking to Kanata, his
Comfort zone, and he’s very relaxed and the convo is paced to his comfort level…
Are actually soooooooo much more painful to read than the chapters where Midori bites back
And makes him feel anxious and have no breathing space to respond “appropriately”
Lmaoo
And they’re only like…? 5 chapters-ish in total between Kanata and Chiaki? Yet they hurt a
Lot…
Just… being subjected to hearing Chiaki talk about so many red flags and exhibit just as
Much, and be satisfied that he at least got to let Kanata know all this is so… what the fuck lol
Woops broke my thread I’ll repost in relation to this tweet:
I mean I know he says this because he's sooo desperate to keep everything
Hes built up safe and secure, but he's also insane for saying that so
Casually like… what. Huh
Shakes him soo much ughhh
He really fucking said “oh dw Kanata you're the only
Person I will never strain myself with hahaha isnt
That so sweet we’re so close and bonded that I can do
That with you while I strain my soul being a hero to everyone
Else” enough. Do not pass go
Kanata keeping in touch with who he is as a person even as he grows up to be an adult…
Whereas Chiaki struggles to maintain who he is as a person as he enters the adult world
………… Hate it here
… Its even worse cuz Chiaki literally vented to Jin before about his fears of possibly
Growing to hate his hobbies when he's older
But then it ends with this that makes me feel like even Kanata didn't know at the time that
Things will change for both of them (not just Chiaki) and help lessen this feeling of distance
And “subjected to the reality of the adult world”…
Like Kanata still didn't have his revelation about Shinobu and Tetora yet, and didn't tell them
Hes a god yet (out of fear of being hated) so he still… didn't know… he can be saved too …
Oh he is soooooo baby he is sooooo cute superest duperest baby actually
I still feel like they phrased the first dialogue wrong… it’s just not the right tenses
But also Chiaki please
Narration: he doesn't know he becomes the girlfriend that makes bentos
Holds in the urge to break another window
Chiaki please… Its okay its okay to not be “the perfect example of an adult” I'm so
Hes just repeating the same problem w heroism
Its like he’s so scared that he has to just be an adult and can't ever be his “youthful” self (or
Else he’ll be disappointing ppl around him) that he further pushes himself to do “adult-like”
Things like “adults drink black coffee right!”
He is sooooooo babyyyyyyyyyyy you can talk about toku all you want ❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ baby. Babu. Squishes his cheeks
The way Chiakis idol story 1 continues to be relevant to this day (even with the latest stories)
Is really impressive… this was a similar issue he vented in that story
Once again the agency denies him from pursuing his dreams (stuntwork, suit actor) because it
Could harm his idol face or waste it away… all that matters to the agency and sometimes even
The public is the face… the surface… the front. The image
Everything that tortures Chiaki
Engstars you're grammar I’m begging
But yeah…
And Midori’s going thru something similar too in his field of work… it’s really no coincidence
Both of their arcs relate a lot to fans perception/views huh…
Ah wait and this is the sort of socmed posts Midori found…? Uhhhh…
That sure explains a lot huh ❤️
I was gonna comment on this but Kanata did it for me lmao yeah thats just you're form of
Justice Chiaki and thats ok.
Uuweh… with supervillains now… this hits
Hard
Since I wanted to double check if he ever says kids in Comet Show… I checked jp its just a -
Tachi (lit. Nagumo and the others)
…
Ugh… I'm just… all of this… ending of Comet Show…
Supervillain… even submarine… I can’t…
Everything mattered… every step
All of it was for that happy ending Chiaki wanted
Chiaki wanted a happy ending that didn't require suffering
But what we learn is that the happy ending can only be acquired by going thru that pain…
You can’t avoid it. The more you do, the farther you stray from the happiest ending
He tried so hard to cancel it out, to be the scapegoat of the pain so that all is left is happiness
But by doing so, he didn't make anyone happy. because everyone loves him and wants him happy
With him. Hah… I'm fine…
Im so glad supervillain came out before engstars Comet Show…
Ah… I remember this part really hurting a lot on my first read
Bc of what Chiaki says at the end here
But now I get it a lot better… the eccentrics were also scapegoats . They werent actual villains,
But within the script, they were
Either way tho, Kanatas trying to say that Chiaki can be selfish and conduct in a manner that
May hurt someone but it matters a lot to him to express what he wants to express
In other words… to be human
But also to be proud/confident of being a human being
Which is what eichi and rinne had. They were desperate and they were willing to sacrifice, but
Most of all they had a pride and dream and wanted to see it through no matter what
Still tho, putting it in the words of being a “villain” wouldnt be clear for Chiaki
So he didn't understand Kanata and tbh neither did I at the time lol goes to show
Im a Chiakip first and foremost tbh
And if anything, Kanatas basically saying to “join” his world a little, every once in a while…
Since the two still sort of live in separate worlds
Is how I feel but I don't know 🤔 its possible this still has more exploration to it in future stories, since
Kanata’s building up to be “the monster of justice” within ryuseitai
Wao it never gets old
The socmed shit is insane bc
This is the context before it
Tetora talks about both. Bothhhh
And then Midori just immediately zooms in on Chiaki like yeah about him— wtf is wrong with
U ?
Like… its not even subtext he is literally specifically searching about /Chiaki/
I feel like its relevant to an extent that Midori mentioned he muted his name and ryuseitai in
Socmed but not about other member’s names tbh… but we’ll see and that is not particularly
Related to Comet Show rn
Ahhh I always always found this part sooo fascinating… how Midori’s the one out of the 3 who
Instantly goes “actually I kinda get their(Chiakis) pov tho” while the other 2 feel upset about it
(to the point even Shinobu was)
Ahh this part is… …
Symbolically, it’s like Chiaki (and Kanata) were going to “die” and leave behind their
Cherished ones. And the reason they are is because the agency felt Ryuseitai n (rst trio’s hard work)
Wasn’t good enough.
It’s like Chiaki’s affirming that it’s so true that he needs to completely cease to exist so that
He’s not factored anymore
This isn’t like repayfes, where they’re inheriting something and their seniors graduate and
Leave
This is literally just, ok guess you're on you're own fr bye ✌️
This chapter alone could have so many thoughts I don’t even know where to begin tbh
Like here how Midori immediately logically goes about this in the “thats what a hero(‘s mask)
Would do, the hero is meant to solve issues and thats what the hero is trying to do rn”
Anyway they really felt abandoned huh I feel like I can really get all their feelings now in the first
Half… on my first read I was like “well this makes sense even if I'm not sure how exactly” but
Now I'm just ah… yeah… of course itd hurt. of course this is nothing like repayfes to them

And thats why Midori hated the way it was compared to it later down the line but I will wait
That thought out until I get there
I remember feeling really annoyed that Comet Show didn't show us the actual conversation
That took place when the agency ordered them around, and how we're just hearing what
Happened through "He said she said", but honestly…
I see now why we don't need to see that scene
Idk how to explain it but… It doesn't really matter how that scene went. All that matters is
How it made the chars feel. How they all responded to it after the fact
Also bc.. Based on Ryuseitai trio's reaction, I think it would have frustrated us as well to see how
Chiaki acted then
Also because I think akira wanted to explore Chiaki's "Approaching everything with logic" traits in a
Different way and so he didn't waste his time writing a scene that wouldn't really significantly
Express it the same way it was expressed in, say, submarine or supervillain
Also it really goes to show how much Kanata loves Chiaki because he doesn't even agree with a
Single thing Chiaki is doing rn, and was subtly working towards sabotaging his plan to leave,
But still did what he's best at doing as Chiaki's cherished comrade: be by his side
So even tho Ryuseitai trio is saying "Both of them" in reality it's only Chiaki in the end (well we knew
That lol) but like… Kanata is sort of "Sacrificing" the positive way Ryuseitai trio see him because he'd
Rather be by Chiaki's side than have him decide that all on his own
I think also this is still pre-submarine so Kanata still felt more connected to Chiaki than the
Other three
But by the end of Comet Show and even further into submarine, he feels much more
Connected with the other three until they are on par with Chiaki
So he takes more risks in just leaving Chiaki on his own
(also because submarine forced Chiaki to be away from Ryuseitai but yeah)
In fact that's… Literally what he did in Comet Show lmao left him on his own with Midori so
That Chiaki could no longer have him as backup
But I will keep those thoughts for those chapters!!! I'm getting ahead of
Myself because ugh the first half is such a good build up to the rest of this story holy shit…
