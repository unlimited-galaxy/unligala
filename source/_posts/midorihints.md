## Hint 1

<div toc>
    <img src="/img/midorimeteorimpact/p1ch5_1.jpg" class="meta-images">
    <div class="desc">Not Quite A Hero 5</div>
</div>

**Explanation:** Chiaki goes to the infirmary to ask Jin to help him save Ryuseitai, because he was Ryusei Rainbow once upon a time, and Chiaki is a big fan of him. He then considers cleaning up the messy room as an advanced payment for asking Jin a favor. Realizing he's doing something that he was never asked to do, he makes a joke out of it.

"A woman invading a guy's life" refers to 押しかけ女房, lit. "a woman who intrudes a man’s home to live with him, regardless of his consent."

**Reason:** At first glance, the "almost acting like a woman invading a guy's life" looks like a silly joke Chiaki's making to himself about the current situation. But if we were to take his words a bit more literally, there *is* someone that later appears in Chiaki's life that fits this description.

That someone is Midori, who Chiaki immediately scouts into the club and unit as soon as he enters the academy. Midori has described how this encounter happened before:

"ADD HERE"

Within the first few days or weeks of knowing each other, Chiaki suddenly decides to take it upon himself to pick up the lazy and unmotivated Midori himself so that he participates in morning practice.

<div toc>

    <div class="desc">Morning Practice</div>
</div>

<div toc>
    <img src="/img/midorimeteorimpact/morningpractice2.jpg" class="meta-images">
    <div class="desc">Morning Practice</div>
</div>

<div toc>
    <img src="/img/midorimeteorimpact/morningpractice3.jpg" class="meta-images">
    <div class="desc">Morning Practice</div>
</div>

Chiaki picking Midori up in the morning and going to school together immediately becomes a daily norm for the two. Typically, Midori's frustration with this is shown in his homescreen lines rather than stories, such as these:

"ADD HERE"


## Hint 2 

<div toc>
    <img src="/img/midorimeteorimpact/p2ch5_1.jpg" class="meta-images">
    <div class="desc">Unqualifed Hero 5</div>
</div>

**Explanation:** 

**Reason:** In Dokisuta, Midori's arrow to Chiaki is shown to be "despite everything he's attached" and "despite saying he's suffocating, he's attached".

## Hint 3

<div toc>
    <img src="/img/midorimeteorimpact/p2ch6_1.jpg" class="meta-images">
    <div class="desc">Unqualifed Hero 6</div>
</div>

**Explanation:** 

**Reason:** An extension of hint 1, but this time a bit more blatant. Chiaki expresses that it's his dream to take a junior home as a senior, even though Subaru tries to tell him that his home is nearby. A year later, Chiaki once again pursues what he was called his "dream", picking up a junior every day and taking him back home, but with Midori this time -- Whose home is also very nearby to the academy.

## Hint 4

<div toc>
    <img src="/img/midorimeteorimpact/p2ch23_1.jpg" class="meta-images">
    <div class="desc">Unqualifed Hero 23</div>
</div>

**Explanation:** 

**Reason:** This line is blatantly a foreshadow that there will, indeed, be someone who accidentally joins the idol course. The fact Chiaki is the one who states this ever-so-confidently gives an interesting layer to his relationship with Midori. Midori is an "unexpected" element to Chiaki, a situation Chiaki never expected to happen...
