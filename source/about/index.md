## Introduction


## Credits

HUGEST thank you to [Ren](https://watatomo.github.io/tl/) who customized this *ENTIRE* site's code to be used for Enstars translators. It's literally all thanks to him that I can make all the translations look pretty and exciting! Another thank you to [stars-ensemble](https://stars-ensemble.tumblr.com/) for guiding me with Github and helping me get used to the setup!

Thank you to [gradualcolors](https://twitter.com/gradualcolors) for their game assets (such as chibis, cards, banners, etc.), and the Ensemble Stars Wiki for its screenshots and data!
